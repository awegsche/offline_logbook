# Offline E-Logbook

## Warning: WIP

This is in a very early stage, don't use it just yet. **It might corrupt your log book entries**.

A detailed documentation will be available soon ...

## Introduction

The purpose of this app is to cache the log book entries locally to quickly display them and search
in them.

Theoretically this could be used as fully functional logbook client, since uploading new events
(and modifying existing ones) is well within the capabilities of the API.
